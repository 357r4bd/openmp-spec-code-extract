This is a suite of Perl and Bourne Shell scripts that I wrote
while at the University of Houston's Department of Computer Science
HPCTools Group (http://www.cs.uh.edu/~hpctools) to help the OpenMP
ARB automate the extraction, testing, and validation of the examples
in Appendix A of the, then, specification version 3.1 draft.

I am placing it on Github in the hopes that others find it useful, including
those that continue tobe involved in the OpenMP Specification process -
something I found to be quite interesting and enjoyable.

It's release under the TWTFYW license. See ./LICENSE for more info.
